- Added loop to Mow The Lawn mod, so it will remove all objects until they are all finished.

UPDATED 19.05.2015

- Fixed a problem where the starting stats on Stats tab was reset when Stop/Start the bot. Now it does not, it will always show the first starting resources until you close the bot.

UPDATED 18.05.2015

- Added Bot Restart to PushBullet remote commands (thanks to @wewawe for the restart script)

- Temporary solution to DE zap (TH snipe + DE Zap) by @janikz211 (https://gamebot.org/forums/thread-2674.html)
Modified it, so you can choose to zap for DE when you choose TH Snipe option. The Minimum Dark Elixir criteria is not read from search options, but from the one in Advanced tab next to enabling Lightning checkbox above

- Replaced Lab tab with Upgrade tab. Moved wall and building upgrade GUI to this tab from Misc.

- Upgrade heroes level by level continuously by @bunana123 (https://gamebot.org/forums/thread-2901.html)

- Separate barracks troop training order for TH Snipe mode.
Archer > Barb > Giant > Healer > Wizard > Dragon > Pekka > Goblin > Wall Breaker > Balloon

UPDATED 16.05.2015

- Added D/R ratio setting for Balanced CC troops deployment. You can specify the ratio (1/2, 1/1, 2/3 anything you want), bot deploys cc troops if the donated/received ratio is equal or greater than the ratio you set.

- Barracks Mode can train Dark Troops as well now.

- Wall Upgrade v3 by @ProMac (https://gamebot.org/forums/thread-2535.html)

UPDATED 15.05.2015

- Mow The Lawn by @barracoda (https://gamebot.org/forums/thread-2681.html)

- Unbreakable mode by @knowjack (https://gamebot.org/forums/thread-2846.html)

- Auto Start Bot by @Sm0kE (https://gamebot.org/forums/thread-2836.html)

UPDATED 14.05.2015

- Runtime is fixed and now it does not reset when you stop the bot. It stops when you pause/stop the bot, and it continues when you resume/start the bot, until you exit the bot completely. This should help getting the stats right.
